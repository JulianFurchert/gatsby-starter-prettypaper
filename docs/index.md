With Pretty Paper, you can easily write your documentation using Markdown. It supports all basic Markdown features such as headings, paragraphs, block quotes or lists.  To quickly write design specifications the syntax has been extended with custom blocks for colors, fonts and text styles.

# Quick Start
Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the pretty paper starter.

```sh
# create a new Gatsby site using the Pretty Paper starter
gatsby new my-docs https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog

# Start developing.
cd my-docs/
gatsby develop

# Open the source code and start editing!
```

# Custom Blocks
Custom Blocks are an extension of standard Markdown syntax. All Blocks are written as tagged Markdown code blocks. [see all Custom Block in action](/Blocks/colors/)
